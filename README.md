# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms-Linked-Lists

A linked list is an alternstive to an array.
The most important characteristic of a linked list differentiating it froman an array is the fact that the data elements are not stored in adjacent memory positions as is the case with arrays.
In Linked lists each item needs to contain information on the memory position of the next item.
The programmer needs to know where the first node is, it is also useful to know thw address of the last node.
Each node consists of 
1. Data element.
2. Address of the following node.
